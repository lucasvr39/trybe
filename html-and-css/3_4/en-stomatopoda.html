        Well, his "baptism" name is <em> Odontodactylus scyllarus </em>. Beautiful name, right?

      <h3>Nature's most powerful <strong>PUNCH</strong> and armor members</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="img/shrimp-limbs.jpg" alt="The Mantis Shrimp's little red limbs and blue body">
        The <strong> Shrimp Mantis </strong> - or the <strong> Boxing Lobster </strong>, if you prefer nicknames - is
        the animal
        with <span> the most powerful punch in nature, whose speed can reach 80km / h </span>. This is
        required to
        break their prey shells, but it can also be used to break aquariums. How about creating
        that pet in captivity? Besides that, its members are so strong that scientists study
        its cellular structure to contribute to the development of armor for combat troops. Ever thought one
        Soldier lobster dress? Or is it a shrimp? Well whatever! I wouldn't be surprised if we found some of these
        little animals fighting MMA in a parallel reality.

      <h3>More than a dozen <strong>Photoreceptors</strong></h3>
      <p>
        <img src="img/shrimp-eyes.jpg" alt="Mantis shrimp's eyes seen up close">
        Most people have about 3 photosreceptors, while <span><strong>Shrimp Mantis</strong> has 12 to 16
          photosreceptores in its medium tray </span>. Therefore, they are very sensitive in color.
        <span>These animals can see ultraviolet, being the most complex UV detection system found in nature</span>;
        which is not necessarily a positive thing. Although they see it as satellites, this makes them worse than other
        animals when it comes to distinguishing colors.
        In this case, we can say that less is more, right?
